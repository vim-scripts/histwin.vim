Vim 7 has an amazing feature that is called undo-branches. See :h undo-tree. Unfortunalley it is a little bit clumsy to use. 

Therefore this plugin allows for easy navigation between the different undo-branches for a file.
See this screenshot: http://www.256bit.org/~chrisbra/vim_undotree.png
This plugin was inspired by the undo_branches plugin (http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1997).

This plugin allows you to
- see all available undo-branches (Timestamps and Keywords)
- tag certain states
- switching to different states (including the first state (before any changes were made)
- allow to diff the selected undo-branch with the current version
- replay the changes (ok, this is just for fun ;)

Open the UndoBrowse window by issuing :UB
A new window will appear, which contains the name of the file you are watching a small help
banner that contains the most important mappings for this window and a list of all available
undo-branches (which shows the time when this change was made and your tags for that state, if there are any). On each entry you can press Enter or T to jump to that state or tag that state.

This plugin maps the following keys:
- 'Enter' on an entry jump to that state in time of the file
- 'T' tags a state with a phrase. 
- 'R' lets you replay a change 
- 'I' opens/closes the help banner
- 'Q' closes the window
- CTRL-L reload view
- D diff selected version
